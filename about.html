<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>
This work started in 2009 in parts of Jaipur, with a small group of women who wanted to earn something of their own but had very limited options. Many of them had family responsibilities, financial pressure, and no formal training. What they did have was willingness to learn and work hard.
</p>

<p>
We began by teaching simple handmade paper products—things that could be made from home with basic materials. Slowly, the women gained confidence. As their skills improved, they started helping and training other women as well. Over time, this became a close-knit group where everyone supported each other.
</p>

<p>
The quality of the work spoke for itself. We started participating in local exhibitions in Jaipur, where our products received a very good response and even secured top positions. These exhibitions helped people notice our work and trust us. With growing recognition, we also received financial support from Bank of Baroda, which helped us expand our work and take bigger orders.
</p>

<h3>What We Make</h3>
<ul style="text-align:left; max-width:600px; margin:auto;">
<li>Handmade bags</li>
<li>Gift and jewellery boxes</li>
<li>File folders and organizers</li>
<li>Greeting cards</li>
<li>Photo frames and decorative items</li>
</ul>

<p>
All products are made using paper materials, with a focus on simplicity, usefulness, and neat finishing.
</p>

<h3>Learning to Handle Big Orders</h3>
<p>
As demand increased, we began receiving bulk orders—sometimes hundreds of pieces at a time, often with short deadlines. The women proved that they could deliver quality work on time. This reliability helped us build long-term relationships with customers.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, our focus naturally shifted towards handmade bags, which are now our main product. Orders have grown from small quantities to large-scale orders.
</p>

<h3>Facing Challenges & Moving Ahead</h3>
<p>
Like many small groups, we faced difficulties during the COVID period, which caused a gap in regular work. But we did not stop. Slowly, we restarted, adapted to new ways of working, and began receiving orders again through calls and WhatsApp.
</p>

<h3>Going Digital</h3>
<p>
Today, we are taking the next step by building our own website to share our story and show our work. We are also planning to sell our products on Amazon, so more people across the country can discover and support handmade, women-led products.
</p>

<h3>Why We Do This</h3>
<p>
For us, this work is not just about products. It is about giving women a chance to earn with dignity, to feel confident, and to stand on their own feet. Every product carries the effort, patience, and pride of the women who made it.
</p>

<p>
This journey has grown step by step—and we are excited to take it forward.
