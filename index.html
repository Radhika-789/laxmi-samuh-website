<!-- OUR STORY -->
<section class="section" id="story">
<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>This work started in 2009 in parts of Jaipur, with a small group of women who wanted to earn something of their own but had very limited options. Many of them had family responsibilities, financial pressure, and no formal training. What they did have was willingness to learn and work hard.</p>

<p>We began by teaching simple handmade paper products—things that could be made from home with basic materials. Slowly, the women gained confidence. As their skills improved, they started helping and training other women as well. Over time, this became a close-knit group where everyone supported each other.</p>

<p>The quality of the work spoke for itself. We started participating in local exhibitions in Jaipur, where our products received a very good response and even secured top positions. With growing recognition, we also received financial support from Bank of Baroda, which helped us expand our work.</p>

<h3>What We Make</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Handmade bags</li>
<li>Gift and jewellery boxes</li>
<li>File folders and organizers</li>
<li>Greeting cards</li>
<li>Photo frames and decorative items</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the years, our focus shifted towards handmade bags, which are now our main product.</p>

<h3>Going Digital</h3>
<p>We are building our website and planning to sell products on Amazon so people across India can support women-led handmade work.</p>

<h3>Why We Do This</h3>
<p>For us, this work is not just about products. It is about giving women dignity, confidence, and financial independence.</p>
